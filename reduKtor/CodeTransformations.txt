0. Peephole optimizations (changing identifiers and integer constants to 0 or 1, removing type qualifiers,
removing a balanced pair of curly braces and all interior text, and removing an operator and one of its operands (e.g., changing a+b into a or b).

1. Remove package
2. LocalToGlobal ?
3. ParamToGlobal
4. Remove an integral/enumeration parameter from the declaration of a function. Define the removed parameter as a local variable of the same function. Initialize the newly local variable to be 0.
5. Remove a nested function invocation from its enclosing expression. The transformation will create a temporary variable with the correct type, assign the return value of the selected nested function to the created variable, and replace the function invocation with this temporary variable.
6-9. Rename fun, parameters, variables, classes to increase readability (post)
10. Make a function return a void +
11. Inliner for simple functions
12. Copy propagation for simple assignments
13. Replace a call expression with a value or variable which has the same type as CallExpr's type. (pre)
14. Replace a CallExpr with a return expression from this callee's body (pre)
15. Simplify Call Expr. Replace function arguments with: 0 for integer and a global temp variable for classes
16. Simplify if-else    +

if (guard1) 
  {... } 
  else if (guard2) 
  else 
  {...} 

to 
  (guard1) 
  {... } 
  if (guard2) 
  else 
  {...} 
if there is no else-if left, the last else keyword will be removed.
17. int[2][3][4] -> int [2][3 * 4] -> int [2][n] -> n - maximum accessing index (to Lists??)
18. Move function body towards its declaration ??????????
19. Remove base class if it has less than 5 declarations. Move declarations into one of it's subclasses
20. Replace derived class with one of it's base classes if the derived class is empty
21. Remove ctor initializer
22. Simplify nested class if ...
23. Remove unused outer class
24. Replace undefined functions --- If there are more than one undefined function with the same type, pick up one and then replace all others with the selected one.
25. Loop derolling???
26. VectorToArray
27. Nullable types to not nullable
28. Delete brackets +
29. Delete between dots????
30. Delete inheritance +
31. Delete constructors and init blocks
